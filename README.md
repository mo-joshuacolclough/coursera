## [Coursera](https://www.deeplearning.ai)

## Setup

1) Clone this repository. `git clone git@github.com:mo-joshuacolclough/coursera.git`
2) `cd coursera`
3) `module load scitools` - Needed for numpy, matplotlib, etc.
4) `jupyter-lab .` - This loads the jupyter lab in the current folder.
5) Open a notebook and have fun!

When in a notebook, pressing `Shift + Enter` will run your code in the current "code cell".
Note that the order matters; some cell's code may rely on code that has been run in a previous cell.
